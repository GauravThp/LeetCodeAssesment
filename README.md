This is a spring boot that provides a bunch of helper methods that developers can extend, play around with implemented code and leverage it as per need. There ain't lunch scripts. All the methods are tested in both positive and negative use cases.
I did a good job of documented the specification of methods expected behavior.(At least I think I have).
