This is a spring boot that provides bunch of helper methods which developer can extends, play arround with implemented code and leverage it 
as per development work. There ain't lunch scripts. All the methods are tested in both positive and negative use cases. 

I did a  good job of documented the specification of what methods is doing and what it's  expected behaviour.(Atleast I think I have). 
All the coding challenges that I have done are from codewars.com.
