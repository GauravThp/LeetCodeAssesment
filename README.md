This is a spring boot that provides a bunch of library that developers can extend, play around with implemented code and leverage it as per needs. There ain't lunch scripts coz it's utility project. All the methods are tested in both positive and negative use cases.I have documented specification of each methods and their expected behavior.Althought no-one would actually read them. 


All the coding challenges that I have done are from codewars.com . User name: Saurock303
